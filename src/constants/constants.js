    description: "This project was a collaborative effort in which our group solved a reasearch problem using data analytics. The research question I chose to answer is wether Race and Gender affected earnings. To do this I used Jupyter Lab to clean, manipulate and create an EDA using the census data. I then used Tableau to create a dashboard to present my findings",
